# Cohesion Game

Inspired by the game Connections, Cohesion is a game where players must connect words together using a common word. When you add this application to your subreddit, your community can create their own games and play them together.

Alongside the game, we also launched a website written in SvelteKit to allow users to play the game outside of Reddit. You can find the website [here](https://cohesion-game.vercel.app/).
